- fix type coercion
    -> snowflake coercion does not seem to be working
    -> optional first argument is not being skipped over (roll.js)
- on get-deleted-messages, move message content above date / time info.
    -> also maybe remove user's avatar as it is somewhat redundant and looks ugly
    -> do same for "random-message"
        ->also fail gracefully if message content exceeds the maximum (1024) chars

- crypto wallets associated with the user
    -> tipping
    -> fund raising
- polls / voting

- games
    - trivia
    - hangman
    - blackjack
    - poker?
